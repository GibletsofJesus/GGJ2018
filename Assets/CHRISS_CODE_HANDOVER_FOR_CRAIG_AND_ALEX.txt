HI!

All input needs to be controller based.  Use COntroller.Button() to get an enum of pressed buttons 
or use Controller.GetButton(ControllerButton.CROSS) to see if a particular button is pressed.

Jump is in, double jump and stomp (press down and Cross/B) or jump x3

can't get wall junping in, and that sucks.

gimme an update tomorrow or something init.

SAFE
